## Projects

### Banking System
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive banking system that addresses the needs of both individual customers and banking institutions. By building a robust and flexible system, we aim to:

1. [**First Version**]( https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/DataEngineeringLab/blob/840a7ba5008140473e775a8b4ec0c5b8b65fa76a/banking_system/banking_system_v1.py): In Version 1, the system introduced a basic menu that allowed users to deposit, withdraw, check their balance, or exit. This version featured fundamental deposit and withdrawal functionalities with hard-coded transaction limits and balance checks. The implementation used simple control flows to handle these transactions, with fixed limits on withdrawals.
   
2. [**Version 2 - First Update**](https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/DataEngineeringLab/blob/840a7ba5008140473e775a8b4ec0c5b8b65fa76a/banking_system/banking_system_update_1.py): Version 2 expanded the system's capabilities significantly by adding new menu options, including creating new accounts, listing accounts, and adding new customers. It introduced more sophisticated functionality by implementing classes and functions for deposit and withdrawal transactions, customer management, and account operations. The IndividualCustomer class was added to manage customer details, and the CheckingAccount class was introduced to handle account-specific transaction limits and management. This version improved user interaction with a more structured approach to handling transactions and account details.
   
4. [**Final Version**](https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/DataEngineeringLab/blob/840a7ba5008140473e775a8b4ec0c5b8b65fa76a/banking_system/banking_system_update_2.py): The Final Version brought advanced structural improvements and refactoring to the system. It adopted a more robust object-oriented design with the introduction of abstract classes and inheritance. The Customer and IndividualCustomer classes managed customer details, while the Account, CheckingAccount, and Statement classes handled account and transaction management. An abstract Transaction class with concrete Deposit and Withdrawal subclasses was added to manage transactions more effectively. This version included detailed transaction logging and enhanced account statement management, improving the system's ability to manage customer accounts and transactions with better handling of transaction limits and balances.
