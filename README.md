# PythonPlayground

Welcome to **Tech-Trek**! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains all my projects and assignments from the Python Bootcamp I'm currently enrolled in. Here, you'll find a variety of scripts and mini-projects that showcase my journey as I learn and apply Python in different contexts.

## Projects

1. [**Banking System**](https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/tech-trek/blob/main/challenge%20-%20banking_system.py):  I had the opportunity to create a ***Banking System in Python***. The goal was to implement three essential operations: deposit, withdrawal, and statement. The system was developed for a bank looking to monetize its operations. During the challenge, I had the chance to apply my Python programming knowledge and build a functional system that simulated banking operations. I prepared to enhance my skills and demonstrated my ability to develop practical and efficient solutions.
   
2. [**Banking System - First Update**](https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/tech-trek/blob/main/banking_system_update1.py): In this challenge, I worked on the optimized version of the previously developed ***Banking System*** using Python functions. The goal was to enhance the structure and efficiency of the system by implementing deposit, withdrawal, and statement operations in specific functions. I had the chance to refactor the existing code, breaking it into reusable functions to make the maintenance and understanding of the system as a whole easier.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## Future Improvements
I'll be updating this repository regularly as I progress through the bootcamp and complete more projects. Stay tuned for more features and improvements!

Add more advanced data analysis projects.

Implement machine learning algorithms.

Expand the README with detailed project descriptions.
